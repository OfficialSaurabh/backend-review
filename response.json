                "title": "Add JSDoc Comments",
                "explanation": "Add JSDoc comments to describe the purpose of the `BookCreate` component and its main event handler (`handleSubmit`). This improves code readability and maintainability, making it easier for other developers (or your future self) to understand the component's functionality at a glance.",

                "explanation": "For more complex forms or if the application grows, using a dedicated form management library like Formik or React Hook Form could simplify state management, validation, and submission logic. These libraries often provide out-of-the-box solutions for error handling, touched states, and more, reducing boilerplate.",
